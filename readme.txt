Increase engagement and drive more repeat traffic to your WordPress site with push notifications. Now a Wordpress VIP Gold Partner.

== Description ==

[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com) is an easy way to increase user engagement. Use OneSignal to send visitors targeted push notifications so they keep coming back. It takes just a few minutes to install.

As a Wordpress VIP Gold Partner, OneSignal has been rigorously tested to handle even the highest volume use cases with reliability and ease of use.

After setup, your visitors opt-in to receive push notifications when you publish a new post. Visitors receive these notifications even after they’ve left your website, thus driving re-engagement.

You can configure notification delivery at preset intervals, create user segments, and customize the opt-in process for visitors.

OneSignal’s free plan allows targeting up to 30,000 subscribers with push notifications. Contact support@onesignal.com if you have any questions. We’d love to hear from you!

= Company =
OneSignal is trusted by over 1,043,856 developers and marketing strategists. We power push notifications for everyone from early stage startups to Fortune 500 Companies, sending over 6 billion notifications per day. It is the most popular push notification plugin on Wordpress with 100,000+ installations.

= Features =
* **Supports Chrome** (Desktop & Android), **Safari** (Mac OS X), **Microsoft Edge** (Desktop & Android), **Opera** (Desktop & Android) and **Firefox** (Desktop & Android) on both HTTP and HTTPS sites.

* **Automatic Notifications** - Send notifications to followers every time you publish a new post. Or set up a reminder that gets automatically sent to them if they haven’t visited for a few days.

* **Targeting Segments** - Send notifications to specific visitors based on language, number of times they’ve visited your blog, or even set up your own user attributes that you can target.

* **Opt-In Customization** - Choose when and how to ask your visitors to opt-in to browser notifications. Customize the prompt they first see.

* **Real Time Analytics** - See your notifications being delivered in real time, and watch them as they convert into visitors.

* **A/B Testing** - Try out different messages to a smaller set of your visitors to figure out which messages are more effective and then send the more effective message to the rest of your visitors!

* **Scheduled Notifications** - Schedule notifications to be delivered in the future, based on a user’s time zone, or even based on the same time of day they last visited your website.

This release changes the notification send rate limit from at most one every 10 seconds to at most one every 1 second.

= 1.16.4 =

This release removes begining and ending whitespaces from textboxes when saving. This can fix common errors like pasting the App ID, REST API Key, or subdomain (also called label) with an ending whitespace which normally causes errors.

- Update AMP helper files to be centralized instead of hardcoded inlined JavaScript

= 1.15.0 =

This release adds a setting for hiding notifications on Mac OS X platforms.

- "Dismiss notifications automatically after ~20 seconds" has been replaced with "Hide notifications after a few seconds" with a couple of
choices "Yes", "No", "Yes on Mac OS X. No on other platforms". Previously, notifications would be persisted on all platforms except Mac OS X.

= 1.14.4 =

This release restores 4 missing image files in the Setup guide included in our WordPress plugin (Chrome & Firefox Push step 7, OneSignal Keys step 2).

No code changes were made in this patch.

= 1.14.3 =
- Use larger sized icons for the featured image

  Notification small icons and large images previously used the uploaded image closest to size 80x80. For a large uploaded image with no
  resized variants, there would be no issues. But for uploaded images resized to different sizes by WordPress, this caused the smallest image
  size to be selected and look blurry. Notification small icons now use the closest available image to 192x192 for a sharper image, whereas
  large images use the closest available image to 640x480.

= 1.14.2 =

  Clarify some steps that are typically confusing to new users setting up the plugin, like how to get the value in the Subdomain textbox.
