* **Target Segments** - Send notifications to specific visitors based on language, number of times they’ve visited your blog, or even set up your own user attributes that you can target.

* **Easy Opt-In Configuration** - Choose when and how to ask your visitors to opt-in to browser notifications.

* **Real Time Analytics** - See your notifications being delivered in real time, and watch them as they convert into visitors.

* **A/B Testing** - Try out different messages to a smaller set of your visitors to figure out which messages are more effective and then send the more effective message to the rest of your visitors!

* **Scheduled Notifications** - Schedule notifications to be delivered in the future, based on a user’s time zone, or even based on the same time of day they last visited your website.

**All completely free. No fees or limitations.**
